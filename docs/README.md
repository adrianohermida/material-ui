# Docs

This is the website of the company (MUI), the documentation of Material UI, MUI Base, MUI System, and Joy UI.

To start the docs site in development mode, from the project root, run:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

If you do not have pnpm installed, select your OS and follow the instructions on the [pnpm website](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Package managers other than pnpm (like npm or Yarn) are not supported and will not work.

## How can I add a new demo to the documentation?

[You can follow this guide](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md)
on how to get started contributing to MUI.
