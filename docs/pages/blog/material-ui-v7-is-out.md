MaterialÂ UI v7 is now stable.
This major improves the integration with modern tools and consistency across the library.
It is designed to be straightforward to upgrade to.
`

## Improved ESM support

The package layout has been updated to comply with ESM.
This is achieved by adding the `exports` field to the `package.json` file.
The `export` field indicates where bundlers can find CJS, ESM, and modern bundle files.
You can read more about this in the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_exports).

This update fixes several issues with popular bundlers like Vite and webpack.
It also reduces the amount of setup required to work with these tools.

## Opt-in support for CSS layers

The `enableCssLayer` prop has been added to `ThemeProvider`.
When enabled, MaterialÂ UI styles are wrapped in a CSS layer named `mui`.

This allows MaterialÂ UI to integrate with modern tools that rely on CSS layers, like TailwindÂ CSS v4.

## Completed the slot pattern implementation

The API for replacing or modifying component inner elements is now standardized, and all relevant components use the `slots` and `slotProps` props for greater flexibility and consistency.
A [guide about this pattern](/material-ui/customization/overriding-component-structure/) has been added to the documentation.

## Removed deprecated APIs

APIs that were deprecated in v5 have been removed.
This reduces the API surface, making the docs easier to navigate.
