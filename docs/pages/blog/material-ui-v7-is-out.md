MaterialÂ UI v7 is now stable.
This major improves the integration with modern tools and consistency across the library.
It's a lean upgrade designed to be straightforward to upgrade to.

## Improved ESM support

The package layout has been updated to comply with ESM.
This is achieved by adding the `exports` field to the `package.json` file.
The `export` field indicates where bundlers can find CJS, ESM, and modern bundle files.
You can read more about this in the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_exports).

This update fixes several issues with popular bundlers like Vite and webpack.
It also reduces the amount of setup required to work with these tools.

## Opt-in support for CSS layers

The `enableCssLayer` prop has been added to `ThemeProvider`.
When enabled, MaterialÂ UI styles are wrapped in a CSS layer named `@mui`.

This allows MaterialÂ UI to integrate with modern tools that rely on CSS layers, like Tailwind CSS v4.

## Completed the slot pattern implementation

The API for replacing or modifying inner elements of components has been standardized.
All components that require it now implement the slot pattern through the `slots` and `slotProps` props.
A [guide about this pattern](/material-ui/customization/overriding-component-structure/) has been added to the documentation.

This increases the consistency between components, making it possible to transfer knowledge from one to the other and improving the developer experience overall.

## Reduced bloat

APIs that were deprecated in v5 have been removed.
This reduces the library's bloat, keeping the API and docs leaner and easier to navigate.
