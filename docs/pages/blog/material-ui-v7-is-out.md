MaterialÂ UI v7 is now stable.
This major improves the integration with modern tools and consistency across the library.
It is designed to be straightforward to upgrade to.
`

## Improved ESM support

Our package layout has been updated, we now unambiguously support both valid ESM and commonjs through the exports field in package.json.
This update fixes several issues with popular bundlers like Vite and webpack, and makes it possible to load our packages from ESM modules under Node.js.

## Opt-in support for CSS layers

The `enableCssLayer` prop has been added to `ThemeProvider`.
When enabled, MaterialÂ UI styles are wrapped in a CSS layer named `mui`.

This allows MaterialÂ UI to integrate with modern tools that rely on CSS layers, like TailwindÂ CSS v4.

## Completed the slot pattern implementation

The API for replacing or modifying component inner elements is now standardized, and all relevant components use the `slots` and `slotProps` props for greater flexibility and consistency.
A [guide about this pattern](/material-ui/customization/overriding-component-structure/) has been added to the documentation.

## Removed deprecated APIs

APIs that were deprecated in v5 have been removed.
This reduces the API surface, making the docs easier to navigate.
Visit the upgrade guide for a [list of removed APIs](/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v7/#deprecated-apis-removed).
