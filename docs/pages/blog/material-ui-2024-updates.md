As the end of the year approaches, we want to take some time to review some of this year's highlights for MaterialÂ UI and update you on what the community can expect moving forward.

## MaterialÂ UIÂ v6 release and support

We released MaterialÂ UIÂ v6 in August, offering new features, fixes, and a smoother migration experience. So far, almost a million users have successfully migrated.

The reception for the new version has been very positive, and we hope many more users can migrate in the upcoming months.

Our focus has been on responding to v6-related issues to support your migration. We thank everyone in the community who has helped by reporting or fixing problems and encourage everyone else to migrate. We are happy and ready to help!

## ReactÂ 19 support

As of today, MaterialÂ UIÂ v5 and v6 support ReactÂ 19. This has been one of our main focuses during the second half of 2024.

Next up, we'll update MaterialÂ UI's dependencies and type versions once ReactÂ 19 is stable.

We hope you start trying it, and we're very grateful to the community members who have been and continue to test and report issues.

## MaterialÂ DesignÂ 3

A year ago, we shared that we expected to have a MaterialÂ DesignÂ 3 implementation by the end of 2024. Due to the efforts mentioned above, this has not been the case yet.

Updating the look and feel in such a big way is very complex. We want to provide the best experience for everyone and we're currently discussing and working on the best way to achieve it. This will be one of our main focuses for 2025.

## Looking towards 2025

We're planning a new major release for the first half of 2025: MaterialÂ UIÂ v7.

This version will fix issues that require breaking changes, including the long-awaited ESM support improvements, and other small fixes.

Note that, while this major release won't contain visual updates since its only focus is fixing bugs, we'll keep exploring the best way to update the look and feel in parallel. We'll continue sharing any details as soon as we reach any decisions.

## Follow along

We'd love to chat with you and are as excited as everyone to update how MaterialÂ UI looks and feels.

To ensure all these updates benefit our community, we'll be conducting interviews throughout this period. If you're interested, you can reach us through [aaron@mui.com](mailto:aaron@mui.com).

Thank you for your continued support, we're excited to go into 2025 with you! ðŸŽ‰
