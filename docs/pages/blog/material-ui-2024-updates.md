As the end of the year approaches, we want to take some time to review some of this year's highlights for MaterialÂ UI and update you on what you can expect moving forward.

## MaterialÂ UIÂ v6 release and support

We released MaterialÂ UIÂ v6 in August, offering new features, fixes, and a smoother migration experience. 
So far, almost a million users have successfully migrated.

The reception for the new version has been very positive, and we hope many more users can migrate in the upcoming months.

Our focus has been on responding to v6-related issues to support your migration. We thank everyone in the community who has helped by reporting or fixing problems and encourage everyone else to migrate. We are happy and ready to help!

## ReactÂ 19 support

As of today, MaterialÂ UIÂ v5 and v6 support ReactÂ 19. This has been one of our main focuses during the second half of 2024.

Next up, we'll update MaterialÂ UI's dependencies and type versions once ReactÂ 19 is stable.

We hope you start trying it, and we're very grateful to the community members who have been and continue to test and report issues.

## MaterialÂ DesignÂ 3

A year ago, we shared that we expected to have a MaterialÂ DesignÂ 3 implementation ready by the end of 2024. 
Due to the more pressing efforts mentioned above, we have not been able to deliver on this yet.

Updating the library's look and feel in such a big way is an incredibly complex undertaking that can't be rushed.
We're committed to providing the best experience for all users and use cases, and we're working hard to determine the best way to accomplish that.
This is one of our top priorities for 2025, and we'll keep you updated on our progress.

## Looking towards 2025

We're planning a new major release for the first half of 2025: MaterialÂ UIÂ v7.

This version will fix issues that require breaking changes, including the long-awaited ESM support improvements, and other small fixes.

Note that, while this major release won't contain visual updates since its only focus is fixing bugs, we'll keep exploring the best way to update the look and feel in parallel. We'll continue sharing any details as soon as we reach any decisions.

## Follow along

Feel free to leave your feedback on these new features and fixes in our [GitHub](https://github.com/mui/material-ui). We'd love to chat with you and are as excited as everyone to update how MaterialÂ UI looks and feels.

Thank you for your continued support, we're excited to go into 2025 with you! ðŸŽ‰
